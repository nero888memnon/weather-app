# weather-app
This Weather Forecast App is a lightweight and responsive web tool built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for any location and view the current weather conditions along with a three-day forecast. Powered by the WeatherAPI, it delivers real-time temperature, weather icons, and descriptive summaries with a clean, user-friendly interface.

The app uses a gradient background and modern design to enhance usability across all screen sizes. Weather data is fetched dynamically and displayed in organized sections to clearly separate current conditions from upcoming forecasts. This project serves as an ideal front-end example of API integration and responsive UI design.
